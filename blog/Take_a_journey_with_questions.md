The first travel invitation I ever rejected was to climb Mount Tai. It came from my aunt and cousin when I was in primary school. I remember they asked me to skip school on weekdays. I still had homework to do. So, I rejected the invitation. There were still three tickets. They traveled to Taian with my cousin's schoolmate and neighbor. I had traveled with them to Dalian before. It was a fascinating trip and the beginning of a boat journey. We played cards on the boat's bed. After arriving in Dalian, we visited the famous aquarium. 



I don't know why my uncle didn't come to Taian with them this time. For me, the journey should be based on my interests, not just the tickets. This principle has occupied my whole life. Except for trips I took before primary school, when I was a child with no control, I only traveled outside our city after graduating from junior high. It was boring for many years without fresh scenery. But I wasn't interested in going out at that time. I spent all my vacations with my parents, grandparents, and many relatives and friends. 



Before I became familiar with youth hostels, I usually chose to visit a city where a relative lived. A roommate introduced me to them when we decided to travel to Xi'an together after field research during my sophomore year summer vacation. After learning the ropes, I started traveling to many different cities in China and abroad. I took different themed journeys by myself: visiting friends who had left, visiting universities for career advice, and visiting geology sites and fountains for relaxation. I tried traveling with others, but it usually ended in failure and unhappiness. So, I had to learn more skills to help me travel by myself. 



My biggest trip so far was for my biology research. In the last year of my undergraduate studies, I wrote a mini proposal to my supervisor. It was the first and last time I visited his office. I usually did experiments in his lab from day to night. His lab focused on microbiology. I worked for him right after finishing my work at the student union. It was a fortunate period with a salary. After that, I wrote my questions about eukaryotes and bioinformatics. My supervisor supported me in finding a new lab.
