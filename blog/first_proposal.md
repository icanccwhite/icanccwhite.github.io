My first research proposal failed during my freshman year. 

I was amazed by the animal biology course and wanna communicate more with the lecturer. He just suggested me a senior engineer. And then the engineer told me I should write a proposal about C. elegant. I need to learn about what it is. I wrote a short proposal after reading some related articles. Then, there was no news about my animal exploration journey during my undergraduate.  I chose microbiology, which is a famous major in our university. My boss gave me a salary when I did some experiments on weekends in the lab. Though all of them are biology, all knowledge is valuable. It nearly changed my track from a talent to a hard work guy.
