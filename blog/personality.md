The last time I met with my maternal grandfather, he still remembered that, in my childhood, I was so critical. As a picky eater, I could split leaves of Chinese chives from boiled dumplings. That was true, and I didn't want to eat too much meat. Though it was changed when I grew up. But the pork is still not delicious to my taste. My grandfather respected my taste, but my mother and grandmother always insist on what they have made in the kitchen. For example, my elder sister's favorite food is fried leek dumplings, and they will also feed me that. I often fight with the inertia of upbringing. The attitude that insists on freedom of choice could exactly describe me.
