When I was a little child, my parents didn't teach me much. When I became a pupil, my teachers didn't teach me too many words about different plants and animals. Or just some words that don't show the real one where they are. So when walking in the street between the home and school, I just identified the willow. I didn't know whether the tallest trees were poplar or birch. And I can't stop the caterpillars dropping from the willow in the summer. I could write kaffir lily represents integrity and uprightness, but I could not identify them from gardens. It was a kind of missing the real world in the teenagers' study life. Shame follows you everywhere.
